## Task

1. Create an `input` element to allow users to **search** for an image. It is up to you to decide if the user should be able to search by title, keyword, or both.
2. Write a **regular expression** pattern to create a **fuzzy search** so that the results are narrowed down and displayed every time the user enters or removes a character from the input.
