# Gallery of Horns

## Task

1. Import the **data.json** file into your App component and send that data into the Gallery component
2. **Map** over the JSON data in your Gallery component to render each beast
3. Send a function into your Gallery component that allows the user to update `state` in the App
4. Create a `SelectedBeast` component and include it in your App
5. Use the `state` in the App to render an individual beast in a **Modal** in the **SelectedBeast** component using *React Bootstrap*

### Stretch

1. Create an `input` element to allow users to **search** for an image. It is up to you to decide if the user should be able to search by title, keyword, or both.
2. Write a **regular expression** pattern to create a **fuzzy search** so that the results are narrowed down and displayed every time the user enters or removes a character from the input.
